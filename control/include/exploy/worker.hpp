/**
 * @brief Asynchronous worker — offloads ONNX inference to a background thread.
 *
 * The pipeline is split across two consecutive `update()` calls:
 *
 * 1. **First call at cycle boundary** — `read_fn` executes on the main thread,
 *    then `work_fn` is dispatched to a dedicated background thread.
 * 2. **Subsequent calls** — if inference has finished, `write_fn` runs on the
 *    main thread to commit joint targets.  If the worker is still busy
 *    (overrun), the cycle is skipped and `update()` returns `true`.
 *
 * This decouples the main control loop from the inference latency, allowing
 * the robot to keep receiving state updates while the GPU or CPU is busy.
 *
 * Thread safety: the internal mutex guards all shared state between the main
 * thread and the worker thread.
 *
 * `reset()` stops the background thread and clears all state. The thread is
 * re-started on the next `update()` call.
 *
 * **Error handling**: when `work_fn` returns false the worker latches into a
 * faulted state. All subsequent `update()` calls return `false` immediately
 * without dispatching new work. Call `reset()` to clear the fault and resume.
