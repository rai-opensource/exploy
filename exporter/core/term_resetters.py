class TermResetter:
    """Manager environment elements that are replaced with exporter-friendly versions.

    This class encapsulates how to replace `ManagerTerm` objects in environment managers with exporter-friendly versions
    and how to set them back to their original type.

    For example, the `EELimbMotionGenerator` generates commands from trajectories that are loaded from file.
    The functionality that we want to export is just how to get/set commands, which is abstracted into
    `EELimbMotionGeneratorExporter`. This class handles replacing the former type with the latter for the export phase,
    and setting the term back to a `EELimbMotionGenerator` when export is done.
